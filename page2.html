					<p class="ferry-text paragraph-one"> As those who live in Seattle know, getting into the city isn’t exactly easy; 
						this first article of a four-part series hopes to make it a bit more tolerable, however. 
						According to USA Today, the Emerald City has the 10th worst traffic in the entire nation. 
						This leaves drivers stuck in gridlock for an average of 54.8 hours a year. It also leaves 
						people swapping out their car rides for boat rides.
					</p> 
					<br>
					<p class="ferry-text paragraph-one"> 
						In fact, traffic is one of the reasons 
						you may opt to commute by ferry instead of Ford Focus. But this isn’t for everyone. 
						Rather, taking to the waterways involves both pros and cons.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="ferry-text paragraph-two">
						But, first, the good news.Some of the pros of the ferry include:

				<div class="ferry-commuting left-side">
					<p class="ferry-text paragraph-three"> <strong> It’s easy to see the schedule.</strong><br> The Washington Department of Transportation offers an app that 
						allows you to view the ferry schedule from your mobile device. You can also see how many drive spots 
						are left and where the boats are in real-time.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="ferry-text paragraph-four"><strong>The galley offers beer and wine.</strong> <br>Of course, some people successfully
							leave work in the office. If you don’t want your boat time to be a bore, there’s always the option of 
							kicking back with a cocktail and enjoying the views of the city skyline from the bay. 
					</p>
					<br>
					<p class="ferry-text paragraph-five"><strong>It's afforable.</strong><br>
						Commuters who walk on (or ride their bikes) find the ferry quite affordable. 
						This is especially true if you buy a monthly pass. An Orca pass allows you to get through 
						the terminal gates before they open, as well, saving you time.

						<p class="ferry-text paragraph-six"> <strong>You’ll meet new people</strong><br>
							It’s easy to treat the ferry like a mini-social hour. It’s filled with the same people, day after day.
							People you can’t help but come to know and come to consider friends.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="ferry-text paragraph-seven">
							On the other hand, some of the reasons to avoid the ferry commute include:
						</p>
						<p class="ferry-text paragraph-eight"><strong>You're driving your car onto the boat.</strong>
							If you’re commuting by ferry and by car, the affordability of the ferry goes out the window. 
							Not only is the actual ride more expensive, but you have to pay for parking once you reach the city. 
							You must also be at the ferry early – sometimes as much as 45 minutes early – to make sure your car gets a spot.
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="ferry-text paragraph-nine">
							<strong>You risk missing the boat…literally.</strong></br>
							Commuting by anything that runs on schedule requires you to be at a certain place, 
							at a certain time. In other words, the ferry doesn’t offer a lot of flexibility – 
							the boat won’t wait if you oversleep or if your three-year-old daughter decides to 
							paint the cat blue. Be ready to go or it goes on without you.						
						</p>
						<br>
						<p class="ferry-text paragraph-ten">Like anything else, there are pros and cons to commuting 
							by ferry. Weighing each one helps you determine the best option. Or do a little bit of both – 
							take the boat a few times a week, and drive the others.
